</p><h2>Day 0: Packing on Christmas Day</h2>
<p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day001.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie beginning to assemble all the stuff... see the map next to the blue towel? The baggie also contained all my planning notes. I managed to forget all at home!! Good thing I did so much study, I could do it all from memory.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day002.jpg" border="1"><br>Why do I always leave essential stuff till the last possible minute? Reinforcement work on my Birdy's home-made front panniers.
</p><h2>Day 1: Driving to Cape Jervis (830km), ferry to Penneshaw, KI</h2>
<p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day101.jpg" border="1"><br>All the stuff and the bikes loaded in the RAV4.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day102.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur making sure that he didn't forget the doohickey at home... shoulda checked the map and notes, dude!!
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day104.jpg" border="1"><br>Mmmmmmmmm cheesecake and cherries on the bank of the Wimmera.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day103.jpg" border="1"><br>I'm already wearing the bike clothes and cycling sandals.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day105.jpg" border="1"><br>The Murray at Tailem Bend.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day106.jpg" border="1"><br>We have arrived at Cape Jervis. Kangaroo Island (KI) looms in the distance accross Backstairs Passage.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day107.jpg" border="1"><br>And there is our ferry. How's that for perfect timing after a 10-1/2-hour drive!
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day108.jpg" border="1"><br>Quickly assembling the bikes with the touring stuff, just in time to board the ferry. If we didn't get the extra 30 minutes due to different time zones, we would have been late.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day111.jpg" border="1"><br>The bikes securely lashed in case of wild seas, but the ferry scarcely rolled in the gentle swells.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day112.jpg" border="1"><br>We're under way! Woohoo!!
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day110.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie is letting the kids know we made it safely.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day113.jpg" border="1"><br>Me making sure the bikes are OK...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day114.jpg" border="1"><br>Couldn't care less about the tin cages though.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day115.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie snoozing, tired after the long day's drive.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day116.jpg" border="1"><br>Goodbye mainland...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day117.jpg" border="1"><br>... and hello Kangaroo Island!
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day118.jpg" border="1"><br>KI isn't exactly over-populated.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day119.jpg" border="1"><br>We're nearing Penneshaw, first stop.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day120.jpg" border="1"><br>After a few 100m cycling we are already at the overnight stop, youth hostel in Penneshaw.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day121.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur wondering if he should pinch one of the engines to put on Connie's bike.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day122.jpg" border="1"><br>Apparently Connie isn't too impressed by the place. Harden up dear, we're camping from tomorrow!
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day123.jpg" border="1"><br>That puts her in  better mood.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day125.jpg" border="1"><br>The place has a great view.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day126.jpg" border="1"><br>Dinner at the local pub. For once Connie is also having a refreshing beer.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day127.jpg" border="1"><br>Making short work of the fish &amp; chips, but struggling with the salad.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day128.jpg" border="1"><br>Leasurely stroll along the shore...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day129.jpg" border="1"><br>... where little penguins are nesting, then turn in for the night.
</p><h2>Day 2: Penneshaw to Flour Cask Bay (90km)</h2>
<p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day202.jpg" border="1"><br>The bikes slept indoors, just outside our room. The place was OK.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day203.jpg" border="1"><br>Having breakfast of champions overlooking the bay.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day204.jpg" border="1"><br>Lip-smacking stuff, that breakfast of champions!
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day205.jpg" border="1"><br>The table was a bit rickety, so leaving Connie sitting primly, I lounged at the railing.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day206.jpg" border="1"><br>The early morning ferry is just arriving.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day207.jpg" border="1"><br>We've got the bikes loaded up and are enjoying a final view of the Penneshaw marina. I hung the backpack (which was almost empty most of the time) over the handlebars soon after this. KI has essentially NO water points along the way only at camps which are generally rainwater tanks. This makes touring harder as you need to factor in that you need to carry all water for the day.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day208.jpg" border="1"><br>At the top of a stiff climb out of Penneshaw, Jur discovers he forgot his towel at the hostel AND still has the room key in his pocket! D'oh!! Down I go...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day209.jpg" border="1"><br>... and back up again after dropping they keys and getting the towel.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day210.jpg" border="1"><br>That climb was 2km at 8% average, peaking at 13%.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day211.jpg" border="1"><br>Bottom gear, standing on the pedals all the way. Into a stiff breeze.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day212.jpg" border="1"><br>Made it! Twice!
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day213.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie looking happy for the view, wearing Quadgod's arm sunprotectors.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day214.jpg" border="1"><br>We soon left the sealed road behind us and pedalled over corrugations. Sometimes very bad.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day216.jpg" border="1"><br>In some places the road was a hard packed solid surface, sometimes quite good, others badly pockmarked which was worse than corrugations.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day217.jpg" border="1"><br>On the steep downhill we spotted this black tiger snake, a monster of at least 1.5m. "VERY DANGEROUS" according to avru.org. It slithered away before I could get a nice close-up.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day220.jpg" border="1"><br>The first stop of the day, Cape Willoughby lighthouse.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day221.jpg" border="1"><br>Stunning view of the mainland this place has... but no water.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day222.jpg" border="1"><br>We were annoyed to learn the lighthouse only opens at 11:30am. So we just wandered around outside and then hit the road again.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day224.jpg" border="1"><br>The Birdy taking a break in the shade...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day225.jpg" border="1"><br>while we tucked into this platter...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day226.jpg" border="1"><br>and mud cake...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day228.jpg" border="1"><br>at a brand-new opened winery not far from the lighthouse at Chapmans River. Still needs some tidying up.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day229.jpg" border="1"><br>After the feed, we had to ascend this steep little tester...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day230.jpg" border="1"><br>and immediately turn right and descend again.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day232.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie put on the fly net to avoid breathing in flies which outnumber humans a billion to one in Australia. Or so it seems.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day233.jpg" border="1"><br>You just have to remember to lift the net to take a sip.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day234.jpg" border="1"><br>Back at the main sealed road. We've done about 60km by now, the bulk on dirt roads.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day235.jpg" border="1"><br>We're heading to Flour Cask Bay near American River.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day235a.jpg" border="1"><br>The last 3km leg has arrived!
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day236.jpg" border="1"><br>Pedalling down the last stretch...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day237.jpg" border="1"><br>The Birdy's back wheel suddenly broke through a hard surface crust into loose sand, almost pitching me off the bike.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day239.jpg" border="1"><br>Unpacking the bikes at the isolated camp site. There wasn't another soul for miles. We got water at the camp.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day240.jpg" border="1"><br>"Go and have a shower, dear, while I pitch the tent."
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day241.jpg" border="1"><br>Freshly showered in this bush shower. The end of a hot day.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day243.jpg" border="1"><br>Just applying some cream to keep the skin supple...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day244.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur waiting for the fuel stove to boil the pot, placed inside the Weber.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day245.jpg" border="1"><br>Having a nice loaf after having dinner and a freshening shower. Only, the water stopped flowing with me covered in suds. Panic!
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day246.jpg" border="1"><br>Decided to put on the fly sheet after all...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day248.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie spots a nice sunset. We were encamped on the edge of a salt pan.
</p><h2>Day 3: Flour Cask Bay to Vivonne Bay (75km)</h2>
<p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day301.jpg" border="1"><br>Morning dawns at Camp Flour Cask Bay.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day303.jpg" border="1"><br>All packed, bottles filled, ready to go. Overnight, a cool front moved in with occasional drizzle and a persistent sou'-westerly.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day304.jpg" border="1"><br>The flies didn't relent, though.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day305.jpg" border="1"><br>Relaxing at Clifford's Honey Farm, first stop.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day309.jpg" border="1"><br>The place was crawling with pure Ligurian bees.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day311.jpg" border="1"><br>We both got burned despite the cloud cover.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day312.jpg" border="1"><br>A less pleasant stretch of dirt road. If it wasn't for the bikes' full suspension, it would have been a great deal less pleasant again.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day313.jpg" border="1"><br>Murray Lagoon from Bald Hill, a 600m walk. For us, a 600m ride. Not exactly a stunning view. Perhaps KI lacks scenery...?
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day315.jpg" border="1"><br>Another view of the lagoon from the road.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day317.jpg" border="1"><br>Having lunch at Kaiwarra Food Barn, and jur dozing off after a hearty meal. It was a very tough day, fighting the bikes through loosely surfaced corrugated dirt roads against the wind.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day319.jpg" border="1"><br>Camp Vivonne Bay. I couldn't get any of the pegs into the hard ground, so I used the bungee cords to various fixing points instead. Those bungees were easily the most handy things we had. No showers here, so we sufficed with a bird bath and filling the bottles.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day325.jpg" border="1"><br>After cooking the evening meal, we donned our cycling windproof jackets and headed for the beach, reportedly one of Australia's nicest.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day324.jpg" border="1"><br>Nice setting for a house, but what if every property owner next to the creek did that? - goodbye bushland.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/pano1.jpg" border="1"><br>Perhaps it looks better in sunshine?
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/pano2.jpg" border="1"><br>Anyway, I found the wind bitterly cold and we headed back to the tent for the night.
</p><h2>Day 4: Vivonne Bay to Western KI Caravan Park (56km)</h2>
<p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day401.jpg" border="1"><br>Next morning after breaking camp we first headed 9km back to Little Saharah to check out the sand dunes.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day402.jpg" border="1"><br>This is the highest dune. It looked bigger than it was so Connie decided she won't be climbing it.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day403.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie sipping my water after climbing the highest dune after all.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day404.jpg" border="1"><br>The south-westerly was blowing the top of the dunes into sharp edges.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day407.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur wearing a hat against the sun and fly veil against flies, neither of which was necessary at Little Sahara.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day410.jpg" border="1"><br>Back at Vivonne Bay, we enjoy a nice cuppa.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day411.jpg" border="1"><br>Riding on, we find some mature grass trees. It's grass that makes like a tree, see?
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day417.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie snaps a piccie of Jack of the Beanstalk's place...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day413.jpg" border="1"><br>and gets caught by a gum tree when trying to get back on the bike.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day418.jpg" border="1"><br>A grass tree that needs a haircut.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day432.jpg" border="1"><br>At Kelly Hill Caves there was no food and no water so we had an ice cream instead, and no active drips inside the caves, so the caves were static.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day426.jpg" border="1"><br>Only fairly minor examples of stalagsomethings. The tour guide went gaga over a single drip that was found a week earlier.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day434.jpg" border="1"><br>Riding on. This section was dubbed Sunshine Avenue.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day437.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie still defeating the flies, while jur keeps mouth firmly clamped to keep out those nasties.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day438.jpg" border="1"><br>Final stop for the day!
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day440.jpg" border="1"><br>Making camp for the night...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day448.jpg" border="1"><br>and enjoying a beer while standing diagonally.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day452.jpg" border="1"><br>Local wildlife: Tammar wallabies (indigenous)...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day458.jpg" border="1"><br>koalas (introduced)...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day450.jpg" border="1"><br>Cape Barron geese (exotic)...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day443.jpg" border="1"><br>weirdo worm (very exotic)...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day546.jpg" border="1"><br>monster fly (possibly alien)...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day548.jpg" border="1"><br>bullant (straight from Aliens) which found its way into our tent. I wasn't touching that aggressive monster with giant jaws and painful sting so coaxed it into a ziplock bag for the night. These are an inch long!
</p><h2>Day 5: Rest day at Western KI Caravan Park (53km)</h2>
<p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day545.jpg" border="1"><br>We stayed on for a "rest" day here to explore the Flinders Chase park.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day501.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie is exploring some wildflowers.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day505.jpg" border="1"><br>More wildflowers...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day504.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur pointing out to dearest that it's all very well staring at flowers but that he's not fixing anything if she tries to violate the laws of nature, see?
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day506.jpg" border="1"><br>The park comprehensively burned down last summer. This is recent regrowth.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day507.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie decides the weather is OK for her to remove some layers.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day511.jpg" border="1"><br>Looking out over the burnt-out park. A green swathe was untouched.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day514.jpg" border="1"><br>These red plants were everywhere after recent good rains.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day515.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie deftly negotiating yet another hill...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day517.jpg" border="1"><br>A lookout to Remarkable Rocks.

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day621.jpg" border="1"><br>Stokes Bay consists of a camping ground with rainwater tank and a cafe, plus some holiday shacks.

<p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day701.jpg" border="1"><br>It's 2009! Taking shelter from the usual freezing mid-summer wind, we boil our eggs. In the process I severely scorched the table with the Esbit stove.

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day707.jpg" border="1"><br>Forgetting totally to snap more pics, we move on. My Birdy's chain fell off twice here.

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day714.jpg" border="1"><br>We headed to Stokes Bush Garden, at the top of a very steep hill. This giant gum flower [Eucalyptus Macrocarpa] was amazing. Each flower as big as a rolled-up spare tube.

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day721.jpg" border="1"><br>Seems like the ideal pet for a girl to have. Scarcely bigger than a rolled-up spare tube.

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day724.jpg" border="1"><br>Enjoying said cuppa. That's it for 1 Jan 2009!

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day804.jpg" border="1"><br>...and we're off to Bark Hut rd. One of the best gravel roads on the island.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day805.jpg" border="1"><br>Highest point and suddenly we have reception! After a week of nothing! Telstra are a bunch of lying... NextG coverage maps aren't real, they are a distant future dream.

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day807.jpg" border="1"><br>All those tin cages with their dust tails make scratchy throats. By and large, drivers were very considerate indeed, most slowing down to limit dust.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day811.jpg" border="1"><br>I'm headed for the undergrowth while Connie catches up on some bike piccies. Her bike carried about 10kg. Mostly underwear.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day809.jpg" border="1"><br>Mine carried about 20kg. Mostly camping gear. She thought my Birdy looked like a jumble sale.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day813.jpg" border="1"><br>Cygnet River, the biggest on the island. The place has severe water shortage and is not totally ideal for self-supported bike touring.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day812.jpg" border="1"><br>This family made the river bank their personal camp site. Common practice decades ago, this is now frowned upon.

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day819.jpg" border="1"><br>As there was limited space in Connie's panniers with all that underwear, we decided not to buy the farm.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day820.jpg" border="1"><br>25km to Kingscote, with the wind in our backs.

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day826.jpg" border="1"><br>This chap makes champion spirits in his kitchen. Our load and his income increased somewhat here. He was ready for 2 cyclists today, but not for the previous lot of 200 thirsty cyclists who happened by some months ago..
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day829.jpg" border="1"><br>And there's lunch.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day828.jpg" border="1"><br>We got some very aromatic honey, "Coastal Flora," to sweeten our tea. The serving lady was very taken aback that as cyclists we didn't order coffee.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day830.jpg" border="1"><br>Kingscote! No camping today, and Connie looking quite satisfied with the lodgings after a week on a Thermarest.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day833.jpg" border="1"><br>The pelican feeding is a must see. The pelicans thought so too.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day835.jpg" border="1"><br>Patiently (yeah right!) awaiting their snack, the birds pose for some closeups.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day838.jpg" border="1"><br>And there's their meal. In the crate, not under the dumb hat...
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day839.jpg" border="1"><br>First demo: giving the first fish to a gull and watching the pelicans drown the gull to get the fish. Really.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day842.jpg" border="1"><br>Only, the gulls were wise to the threat and with pelicans watching with a murderous glint to their eyes, the gull decided to leave the fish.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day845.jpg" border="1"><br>Showing mercy to the gulls, the fish guy heaves handfulls of fish in our direction. Check out the bird in the centre with brimming beak pouch, next to the bird with open beak. He got the lot.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day850.jpg" border="1"><br>The rest of the fish is hurled into the water for some water sports. A very interesting show that was. Free, too. If you ignore the $3 donation.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day853.jpg" border="1"><br>Dinner in the local pub, as usual the wind was freezing so we declined the al fresco dining location. Marron on the menu. (Google it.)

<p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day901.jpg" border="1"><br>Next day. We have left Kingscote and its pelicans and make our way to American River. Via the Emu Ridge eucalyptus oil distillery.

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day910.jpg" border="1"><br>This is what cyclists have to deal with - pea gravel. Those little iron laterite balls are about 1cm in diameter and very high in iron content. Stone age ball bearings, see?

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day921.jpg" border="1"><br>I'm making breakfast, letting raw oats soak overnight in plain Yoghurt. Deliciously naturally sweet the next morning.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day922.jpg" border="1"><br>And I've got company while I'm cooking!

</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day1005.jpg" border="1"><br>Prospect Hill. A whacking great sand dune.

He came from that lagoon on the left where his ship lay at anchor. American River lies on that headland away in the distance.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/day1010.jpg" border="1"><br>Only, the hill is located on the island's narrowest point, so to his great surprise, all he saw on the other side was the open ocean.
</p><p><img src="./Kangaroo Island Cycling Tour Holiday 26 Dec 2008 - 5 Jan 2009_files/pano1-1.jpg" border="1"><br>The place has 360 degree views. Lagoon to the left, ocean to the right, road to Penneshaw down the middle.
