<center><h1>New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010</h1><p>
</p><p>The plan was to fly to Dunedin from Melbourne, take the Taieri gorge tourist train to Middlemarch which is the start of the Central Otago Rail Trail, and start cycling from there, making an anti-clockwise circle down to the southern coast via Queenstown and Invercargill, and back to Dunedin. I wanted to be travelling west to east when down south in case of bad weather, since the prevailing winds are westerly. That turned out to be the single best decision of the entire tour.
</p><p>From Dunedin, we would rent a car and make our way up the west coast to Auckland on the North Island where Connie spent her early childhood.
</p><h2>Day 1: Travelling to Dunedin</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/001.jpg" border="1"><br>The Moulton packed in its suitcase. I tied everything together with cheap cable ties so the whole works could be lifted out while staying together in a nice package, in case airport inspectors wanted to mess with my bike. That way there would be little difficulty getting it back into the suitcase.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/002.jpg" border="1"><br>The Reach. After several fruitless evenings me trying to shoehorn the Reach into the suitcase, Connie found the only orientation to fit it into the suitcase, in one easy go. *jur red-faced*  I had to remove even the seatclamp to make it fit. And it wouldn't fit in the red suitcase.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/003.jpg" border="1"><br>Ready to go, just the panniers!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/004.jpg" border="1"><br>Loitering at the airport, me shaven short for 4 weeks of growth.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/005.jpg" border="1"><br>Hello New Zealand!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/007.jpg" border="1"><br>That's the Taieri Gorge Railway which will be the first leg tomorrow morning.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/008.jpg" border="1"><br>Dunedin! I can see the world's steep<b>est</b> street.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/011.jpg" border="1"><br>This backpackers must on be the world's second steepest street. A slightly portly chap stumbled into the place a bit later, blowing like a loco on steroids after walking from the bottom. He looked ready to chuck his cookies.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/013.jpg" border="1"><br>Assembling the Moulton... chain, mudguards and racks still to go. I'm not sure I will take the Moulton overseas like that again, too much work. It might be easier if I have a set of clips to clip everything together for the suitcase package.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/014.jpg" border="1"><br>Reaching for the Reach... no wonder my back muscles were buggered.
</p><h2>Day 2: Dunedin to Middlemarch (train) and Middlemarch to Waipiata (56km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/015.jpg" border="1"><br>We're off! I rode down but Connie decided walking is safer.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/016.jpg" border="1"><br>Station buildings are often very ornate things, from the days when rail travel was the most important way. Pity about the buses spoiling a nice view.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/017.jpg" border="1"><br>The entire inside was done with glazed tiling. No re-painting needed, ever.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/018.jpg" border="1"><br>I wonder how long it took to do the floor. Still in pristine condition after, what, a century? What a pity rail travel is obsolete except as tourist attraction.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/020.jpg" border="1"><br>Our carriage awaits!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/021.jpg" border="1"><br>Just making sure the bikes are securely stowed...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/022.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie making sure I am securely stowed.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/024.jpg" border="1"><br>We have reached the Taieri gorge.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/025.jpg" border="1"><br>It drizzled a bit at this scenic stopover.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/026.jpg" border="1"><br>Climbing ever higher...  I saw this spot from the air yesterday, it's in the middle of the pic above.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/028.jpg" border="1"><br>We have now left the gorge, approaching Middlemarch, the start of the cycling leg for the day, some 56km.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/029.jpg" border="1"><br>Fussing over my Moulton under the only shelter to be found...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/030.jpg" border="1"><br>And we're at the start!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/031.jpg" border="1"><br>Drizzly weather, and the low clouds obscured the Rock and Pillar Range.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/033.jpg" border="1"><br>Hmmm. A crash. Hope that won't be happening to us.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/034.jpg" border="1"><br>Nice rural scenery. These veggies stank terribly. We found them regularly on this tour and they always stank.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/035.jpg" border="1"><br>At Hyde drizzle threatened again but we managed to miss most stuff. They had severe water restrictions - only patrons were allowed to use the toilets.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/036.jpg" border="1"><br>Still following the Taieri river upstream...

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/038.jpg" border="1"><br>At tunnels on rail trails you are likely to have company. I like the way the tunnel builders had the minimum impact on the mountainside, just an opening tucked away neatly.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/039.jpg" border="1"><br>Just checking the clearance between front pannier and wheel. Standing on the pedals made the front suspension depress enough to make things almost touch.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/040.jpg" border="1"><br>I had 2 small panniers, one on the standard Moulton APB rear rack, one on a Xootr cross-rack mounted on the head tube. Nice streamlined setup with fully suspended luggage. At this point the backpack was also hanging on the front, under the yellow rain cover. I refined the setup right till the end.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/041.jpg" border="1"><br>The Reach had 2 large panniers hanging on the standard Reach folding rack. An Ortlieb small handlebar bag served as Connie's handbag, very convenient. She used this identical setup till the end.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/042.jpg" border="1"><br>We each use a rear view mirror mounted on the helmet. When you get used to it, you never want to do without it again. It allows you to take to the shoulder when big vehicles approach, or to wave thanks to drivers after waiting patiently behind you for a safe passing opportunity.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/043.jpg" border="1"><br>Here we are at the first stop, Peter's Farm Lodge in Waipiata. I found it on Peter's Otago Rail Trail website.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/045.jpg" border="1"><br>Pretending to enjoy a beer in Peter's lounge. Actually I did enjoy a beer or 2 with Peter. And we had the whole place to ourselves. Just the previous night the place was packed.
</p><h2>Day 3: Waipiata to Alexandra (98km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/046.jpg" border="1"><br>It's dawn and we're preparing to head off. About 100km planned for today, which Peter thought a big bite. Peter's horse cropped Peter's lawn on this foggy morning.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/047.jpg" border="1"><br>The fog condensed on our woollens and glasses, and the tip of my nose. Not to mention hid the scenery.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/049.jpg" border="1"><br>"Dearie, I'm just gunna check if there is a better small-wheeler here than my Moulton."
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/050.jpg" border="1"><br>"Found one! Solid tyres, too, no punctures!" However I couldn't find a way to hang my panniers so was stuck with the Moulton.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/051.jpg" border="1"><br>"Dude, how do you see much in this fog?" Ranfurly and a nice coffee. The little towns along the railway were virtual ghost towns when the railway closed, but the rail trail caused a renaissance. There are quite large numbers of riders on the trail, all drinking coffee and overnighting somewhere.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/052.jpg" border="1"><br>After the coffee, the sun burned the fog away and a brilliant day is revealed. Plus some scenery. Between Ranfurly and Wedderburn we used the road.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/053.jpg" border="1"><br>Wedderburn, near the middle of the trail. Here we returned to the trail. Connie made me pose at anything that deviated from ordinary rail trail stuff. That old green railway shed was found in someone's pasture from where it was moved back to its rightful spot and restored.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/055.jpg" border="1"><br>Just after Wedderburn, we reached the highest point. The sign proclaims "It's all downhill from here." Riiiiiiiight.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/056.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie in a posing mood.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/057.jpg" border="1"><br>I don't like poses so snap these sort of things.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/059.jpg" border="1"><br>Quick banana to replenish the sugar levels...

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/061.jpg" border="1"><br>We donned hats under the helmets for sun protection.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/062.jpg" border="1"><br>The trail passed through a gorge here. We met the 2 helmeted people in the background again and again over the next few days. They took our picture at the highest point just a while back.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/063.jpg" border="1"><br>"Shall we go, Luv?"
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/064.jpg" border="1"><br>Another tunnel. These required bike lights. Smoke from long ago stained the stone-work.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/065.jpg" border="1"><br>Long ago some guy thought it would be nice to have a Crack willow next to a stream, now the whole country is infested with Crack willows next to the rivers; male plants only, propagating via pieces breaking off and carried further.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/066.jpg" border="1"><br>And Connie manages to find a rose. The railway builders had a camp here.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/068.jpg" border="1"><br>There were lots of these large viaducts making our passage nice and level.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/069.jpg" border="1"><br>I was worried about wind as we were travelling opposite to the prevailing winds direction. However, not a breath stirred. Plus it was indeed mostly very nicely downhill.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/070.jpg" border="1"><br>All this cycling is thirsty work. I downed a whole litre of juice. Plus half a litre of milk.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/072.jpg" border="1"><br>"Hold my bike dear, while I snap a piccie of my shadow." The trail surface was quite decent, mostly.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/073.jpg" border="1"><br>Alexandra, our overnight stop. We met the other cycling couple yet again who also overnighted in the same camp - Olivia and Ashleigh, also from Melbourne.
</p><h2>Day 4: Alexandra to Cromwell (42km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/074.jpg" border="1"><br>After attending a church service we reached Clyde, first town after Alexandra. The rail trail ends here due to being submerged under a hydro scheme dam.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/075.jpg" border="1"><br>So we take to the road from here.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/076.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie forgets to stand <i>behind</i> the camera when taking pics...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/077.jpg" border="1"><br>The old Clyde rail building is what she wanted to snap.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/078.jpg" border="1"><br>The dam wall where the old rail embankment dips under the water.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/079.jpg" border="1"><br>The dam is in a narrow gorge all the way to Cromwell, 30km away.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/080.jpg" border="1"><br>So we have a nice ride ahead, but Connie wants a snack first and I am carrying all the food in the front pannier.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/082.jpg" border="1"><br>We met another lone cycle tourer, Tom from the US who took this pic.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/084.jpg" border="1"><br>This is what was left of old Cromwell after the dam filled up.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/085.jpg" border="1"><br>We took lodging in old dam builder dormitories, now a backpackers.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/086.jpg" border="1"><br>Tom pursuaded me to buy a sixpack of beer and share it with him. I didn't need any pursuading at all.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/087.jpg" border="1"><br>Tom was touring on an old Raleigh steel bike with quite nice lugging.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/088.jpg" border="1"><br>He used to be a mechanical engineer, got fed up with society and is now a lifestyle coach. Not sure what that might be.
</p><h2>Day 5: Cromwell to Queenstown (77km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/089.jpg" border="1"><br>Next morning I just manage to snap Connie as she sprints away full of vigour.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/090.jpg" border="1"><br>Brilliant weather again.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/091.jpg" border="1"><br>It is quite dry in this region and fire danger is set to "high."
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/092.jpg" border="1"><br>We are riding up the Kawarau Gorge today, sharing the road with cars who can pass us 5km ahead.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/093.jpg" border="1"><br>Just reading the instructions for riding up the gorge...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/094.jpg" border="1"><br>Dulcet Connie stares at Roaring Meg, a small hydro-electric scheme.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/095.jpg" border="1"><br>Just beyond Roaring Meg was this steep little tester.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/096.jpg" border="1"><br>We were wearing full sun protection again.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/097.jpg" border="1"><br>Bikes get to jump the queue, heh heh.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/098.jpg" border="1"><br>The gorge widened a bit and we found some wineries. Just the sort of place for having the first coffee of the day.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/099.jpg" border="1"><br>"Let's go to this one, dear."
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/100.jpg" border="1"><br>Ha! Apple thief caught red-handed!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/101.jpg" border="1"><br>That apple must have tasted nice because she is all smiles.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/102.jpg" border="1"><br>Right, stopped for coffee. I had 2 water bottles. Connie, who forgot her second bottle in Melbourne, made me carry a milk bottle with water for her.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/103.jpg" border="1"><br>This winery is making loads of cash.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/104.jpg" border="1"><br>Very nice garden, too.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/105.jpg" border="1"><br>At the Kawarau river crossing is an old suspension bridge with the "world's fir<b>st</b>" commercial bungy jumping enterprise.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/106.jpg" border="1"><br>There he goes. We didn't go. At a price costing more than our air fare, I decided to save the money for another tour in Middle Earth.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/107.jpg" border="1"><br>He dunked into the water and the force of the water stripped his T-shirt right off. The guys in the dingy rescue jumpers once they hang still. Jumpers are very quiet when they first emerge from the water. I suppose getting yanked upside down from a river puts a lot of water up one's nose.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/108.jpg" border="1"><br>The water is coloured this fantastic blue colour by suspended rock particles washed down from snowmelt.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/109.jpg" border="1"><br>Heading to Arrowtown, a nice little goldrush village.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/110.jpg" border="1"><br>Very hip little town with two hip cyclists on hip little small-wheelers.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/111.jpg" border="1"><br>Making short work of a chocolate ice cream, just the thing for the burning sun. I am wearing my white sun arm protectors, better than slathering on sunscreen all day.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/112.jpg" border="1"><br>After taking a wrong turn we find this little gem of a lake.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/113.jpg" border="1"><br>I wonder if I can find a job here.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/135.jpg" border="1"><br>Finally after much strife and an extremely steep little climb after crossing the Shotover river, we arrive at Shotover camp.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/114.jpg" border="1"><br>I felt like a potato chip at the end of a full day in the hot sun. I moved a chair into the shade and fell promptly asleep.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/115.jpg" border="1"><br>This was the view through the window of our cabin.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/116.jpg" border="1"><br>And this was the view through the door. I found myself enjoying this view more often. Weird, huh?
</p><h2>Day 6: Rest day near Queenstown (21km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/117.jpg" border="1"><br>Yet another sunny day dawns brilliantly.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/118.jpg" border="1"><br>Barreling down the gorge 7km to Queenstown. We headed straight for the cableway.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/119.jpg" border="1"><br>Managed to snap the bikes as the cable car whizzes past. Bikes are securely chained to that chain.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/120.jpg" border="1"><br>Car drivers have to park a long way away and hoof it to the terminal, but we get to park the bikes right at the door. *smug*

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/122.jpg" border="1"><br>I expect stunning views at the top.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/123.jpg" border="1"><br>But meanwhile there are stunning views right next to me.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/124.jpg" border="1"><br>Queenstown must have one of the most breathtaking settings in the world. Tomorrow we head south all along the southern arm of the lake, just left of the middle in this panorama.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/125.jpg" border="1"><br>I wanted to walk to the summit, several hours of climbing, but Connie was having none of that, being fatigued from yesterday's long haul. So we just had a short walk at the top of the cableway. That turned out a waste of time - no views, just dark pine forest. Plus it was very hot.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/126.jpg" border="1"><br>I wanted a luge ride. She also thought it a blast.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/127.jpg" border="1"><br>Of course once is not enough so here we are taking a small ski lift back to the top of the luge track.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/128.jpg" border="1"><br>If you can't snap nice piccies here you can't blame the camera. That's the Remarkables range in the background.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/129.jpg" border="1"><br>Back at the bottom it's lunch time - fish and chips at the lake edge.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/130.jpg" border="1"><br>After buying groceries, we headed the 7km up the gorge back to camp. This is the Shotover river gorge.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/131.jpg" border="1"><br>"Oh Luv, let's go on the Jet boat!"
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/132.jpg" border="1"><br>So here we are at the riverside awaiting our turn on the famous Shotover Jet.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/133.jpg" border="1"><br>Amid fantastic scenery, the jet is piloted literally inches from rocks and cliff faces at dizzying speed. Quite a buzz. I asked the pilot if he ever crashed into the rocks before and he said yep, a few times. That was comforting actually, because he's had that experience.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/134.jpg" border="1"><br>Relaxing at the waterside afterwards and, unbeknown to us, getting bitten something horrid by sandflies. Itchy little buggers.
</p><h2>Day 7: Queenstown to Kingston (54km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/136.jpg" border="1"><br>"Uh Dearest, we're going the other way!"

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/138.jpg" border="1"><br>As usual the weather was simply brilliant. The locals informed us (a bit grumpily) it is extremely unusual to have calm, windless, sunny weather a whole week in a row.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/139.jpg" border="1"><br>The bikes waiting patiently while we visit the facilities inside...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/140.jpg" border="1"><br>The outflow of lake Wakatipu. This is a single lane bridge with traffic lights to regulate traffic each way.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/142.jpg" border="1"><br>These are the Remarkables, The legs pedalling that bike were pretty remarkable too, mate!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/143.jpg" border="1"><br>Heading south, a few clouds are drifting in.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/144.jpg" border="1"><br>Quiet roads, dizzying scenery, great company, riding my freedom machine... what a holiday!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/145.jpg" border="1"><br>That cap made from thin synthetic material with sun shroud at the back, was easily my most useful garment. It provided protection agains sun, warmth around the ears, and as I was soon to find out, kept my head dry in the rain. 
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/146.jpg" border="1"><br>Arriving back at the lake edge after going around the hill at the lake corner near Queenstown.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/147.jpg" border="1"><br>The wind picked up but behold, a tail wind!

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/149.jpg" border="1"><br>While the roads were mostly empty, vehicles would arrive in batches. Must be something to do with the single-lane bridge over the lake outflow.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/150.jpg" border="1"><br>We had to put up with this stuff all day.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/151.jpg" border="1"><br>Final glimpse of Queenstown behind... I am definitely coming back here, God willing.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/152.jpg" border="1"><br>Having a bite halfway down. Opposite is a break in the mountains called Halfway Bay.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/153.jpg" border="1"><br>The bikes enjoyed the scenery too. 
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/154.jpg" border="1"><br>Tiring of the magnificence all around us, Connie stares at the road shoulder for a while.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/155.jpg" border="1"><br>This is one of those pics Connie wants framed.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/157.jpg" border="1"><br>I wore the same shirt every single day as I was able to wash it at the end of every day - I never wore my 2 other cycling shirts. Not Connie who was cycling through her cycling tops. 
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/158.jpg" border="1"><br>The weather was turning slightly gloomy towards mid day. Not Connie who remained very sunny.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/159.jpg" border="1"><br>We've had our lunch break and it's time to go.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/160.jpg" border="1"><br>That's Kingston at the bottom end of lake Wakatipu.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/162.jpg" border="1"><br>Southwards, ominous-looking clouds were roiling overhead.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/163.jpg" border="1"><br>Kingston ahead!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/165.jpg" border="1"><br>Hmmm... maybe I should get a spa bath unit...?
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/164.jpg" border="1"><br>Instead we took up residence in this modest little shack.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/166.jpg" border="1"><br>Kingston is a little jewel. No grocery shops though. That there in the distance are disused railway buildings.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/167.jpg" border="1"><br>This is the disused Kingston Flyer.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/168.jpg" border="1"><br>Cobwebs and an Elizabethan cast iron plaque tell the story.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/170.jpg" border="1"><br>There are on-going plans to restore it. If it had been a going concern, I would have made a leg of our journey on it.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/171.jpg" border="1"><br>One loco was dusty and dirty while the other was clean and brightly polished.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/172.jpg" border="1"><br>"Do we need any wheels, dear?"
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/173.jpg" border="1"><br>With no shops in Kingston, we had a meal at the pub which was the only thing still working in the disused railway buildings. The girl serving at the pub counter was also the chef and cooked really fantastic dishes. Highly recommended.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/174.jpg" border="1"><br>The front wheel had a persistent click with each revolution sounding like a loose spoke. I checked speedo magnet, spoke tension, bearings... nothing. I think it was the pinned rim hoop joint making the sound. I decided I would fix it when it falls off.
</p><h2>Day 8: Kingston to Mossburn (64km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/175.jpg" border="1"><br>A little bleary-eyed, Connie is preparing brekkie while I make tea.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/176.jpg" border="1"><br>It's just after dawn and we are ready to go.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/177.jpg" border="1"><br>We barely made it to the office when it started raining lightly. On with the pannier covers and rain gear. A bumble bee is taking shelter under the eaves.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/178.jpg" border="1"><br>It rained lightly on and off but Connie just kept on smiling.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/179.jpg" border="1"><br>At Garston ("NZ's  most inland village" at 129km) the rain started in earnest. And a headwind which we thought was quite fresh but the locals said, "That's not wind!"
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/180.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie donned all her rain gear and said a little prayer for coffee. The pub remained closed though.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/181.jpg" border="1"><br>I don't need no stinking coffee.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/182.jpg" border="1"><br>I wonder what this shop sells... "Sorry, dear, I don't see any coffee!"

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/184.jpg" border="1"><br>Ah, there's the turn-off to Mossburn.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/185.jpg" border="1"><br>Coffee at last in a disused garage turned into a nice coffee shop. I am wearing Rainlegs which just cover the front of the thighs so you don't become sweat-soaked.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/186.jpg" border="1"><br>With the weather turning icy, Connie nicked my buff for face warmth. I turned my ear warmer band around and placed it over my chin which I discovered made all the difference to warm my face without obstructing breathing.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/187.jpg" border="1"><br>Nearing our overnight stay at Mossburn Country Park. Today was our coldest day.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/188.jpg" border="1"><br>Another modest little cabin. When we got there, the sunny weather had returned. It was still quite chilly. 
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/189.jpg" border="1"><br>"Yes dear, I can see you behind that feather..."
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/190.jpg" border="1"><br>These chickens took an instant liking to my Moulton.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/191.jpg" border="1"><br>This one snuggled up to the front wheel.
</p><h2>Day 9: Mossburn to Te Anau (71km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/192.jpg" border="1"><br>It rained when we woke up and Connie refused to go out so we slept a bit longer.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/193.jpg" border="1"><br>It was mostly dry when we started out but the fresh little headwind was still there. First, brekkie at Bracken Hall. (Locals pronounce it <i>Brecken Hole</i>.)
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/194.jpg" border="1"><br>The weather brightened as we progressed but the wind strengthened.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/195.jpg" border="1"><br>It'll be a while before they use up all the sheep...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/196.jpg" border="1"><br>We put our heads down against the wind and made a run for Te Anau in four 16km dashes, Connie drafting me closely. First stop.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/197.jpg" border="1"><br>Second stop.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/198.jpg" border="1"><br>Third stop. And what on earth is making that screaming roar...?
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/199.jpg" border="1"><br>Oh I see - these deer. We passed lots of deer farms today.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/200.jpg" border="1"><br>Rainy spots were all over.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/201.jpg" border="1"><br>However we stayed dry.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/202.jpg" border="1"><br>We're there! Places with nothing to offer often dub themselves "gateways" to something more glamorous. Te Anau are a bit hard on themselves - they have a fantastic lake.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/203.jpg" border="1"><br>Stunning Lake Te Anau. "The larg<b>est</b> freshwater lake in the southern island in surface area" and "the larg<b>est</b> freshwater lake in Australasia in volume." (Wow fancy that. I feel real important now.)
</p><h2>Day 10: Bus &amp; boat tour to Milford Sound and back</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/207.jpg" border="1"><br>Having a rest day in Ta Anau, we took a tour to must-see Milford sound. We were the first to be picked up so got front seats, yay!

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/206.jpg" border="1"><br>Typical of tour operators, it stopped at a number of free scenic places. Can you see the name of this scenic spot? Clever.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/208.jpg" border="1"><br>This toilet stop was free, too.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/209.jpg" border="1"><br>The glacier valleys were simply breathtaking. It's not that high in altitude so the snow surprised me. Not all that suitable for easy cycle touring, the road to Milford Sound is over 100km long with no coffee stops, has mostly no shoulders and is packed with traffic especially buses and camper vans.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/211.jpg" border="1"><br> It also climbs a lot to this, the Homer tunnel. One way traffic.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/212.jpg" border="1"><br>One the other side, the road plunges down the glacier valley in a bunch of steep switchbacks.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/213.jpg" border="1"><br>A lone cyclist... makes no money-sense... the bus trip was included in the boat tour fee. On a bike, you still need to overnight at the Sound plus see to meals besides taking a boat trip.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/214.jpg" border="1"><br>They have tree avalanches over here... never knew of something like that. One tree gets too heavy, topples and causes all vegetation below it to join the avalanche, stripping the rock bare.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/232.jpg" border="1"><br>Our boat awaits!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/215.jpg" border="1"><br>Iconic Mitre Peak... I thought  Milford would be a bit crowded with lots of tour boats but there are only a few boats and the Sound is very large.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/216.jpg" border="1"><br>Heading to the mouth...

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/220.jpg" border="1"><br>The fjord walls plunge so steeply that the captain could take his boat right next to the rock to observe some playing baby seals.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/221.jpg" border="1"><br>The Sound's mouth, right behind Connie's mouth. 200 years ago, Captain Cook mistook the fjords for sounds and mis-named them.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/222.jpg" border="1"><br>It was quite chilly so I wore all my layers of clothing including 2 jackets.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/223.jpg" border="1"><br>"Oh come look at all those silly people pointing their cameras at us! Never fails!"
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/224.jpg" border="1"><br>This place gets huge amounts of rain so waterfalls are common.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/225.jpg" border="1"><br>The captain maneuvered the boat right under the falls...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/226.jpg" border="1"><br>...so we got a drenching <i>a la Maid of the Mist</i> at Niagara...


</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/229.jpg" border="1"><br>And Connie manages yet again to brighten a gloomy day.




</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/235.jpg" border="1"><br>Soaring peaks...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/236.jpg" border="1"><br>plunging streams...


</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/239.jpg" border="1"><br>Permanent ice field at Homer tunnel.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/240.jpg" border="1"><br>That ice field is stained from soot all the way from the Melbourne bush fires from last year.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/241.jpg" border="1"><br>The left-overs of an avalanche from last winter which blocked the tunnel with snow 20m deep.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/242.jpg" border="1"><br>Replenishing Connie's bottle from a pure mountain cascade...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/243.jpg" border="1"><br>Aahhhh... 99.9% pure water. Beer is only about 95% pure.
</p><h2>Day 11: Te Anau to Manapouri (24km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/244.jpg" border="1"><br>This day we only did a short hop to Lake Manapouri. The plan was to attend church but I wasn't feeling well at all, so we hopped on the bikes and rode off.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/245.jpg" border="1"><br>As we approached Manapouri the wind was reaching gale force from our right. And at Te Anau not a leaf stirred! We were almost blown off our bikes.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/246.jpg" border="1"><br>We reached Manapouri before 12pm. What an intersting camp that was. As usual, we had a modest little shack.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/247.jpg" border="1"><br>We were in time to take a tour to the hydro power station on Lake Manapouri. (Check out that huge scar from a tree avalanche.)
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/248.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie chewed on a sandwhich while the captain nibbled on a microphone.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/249.jpg" border="1"><br>"Mmmmm, nice microphone, that..."
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/250.jpg" border="1"><br>"Lake Manapouri is the loveli<b>est</b> lake in NZ." I found the Kiwis were fond<b>est</b> of the letters "<b>est</b>."
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/252.jpg" border="1"><br>With the boat cruising directly into the gales, all the spray on the windows made viewing impossible.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/251.jpg" border="1"><br>Now I know what a piece of clothing in a washing machine feels like.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/253.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie went on the upper deck for a nice view and got instantly drenched.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/254.jpg" border="1"><br>It IS a rather pretty lake...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/255.jpg" border="1"><br>The hydro power station water inlet. The power station is deep underground which is reached by bus in a long spiral tunnel.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/256.jpg" border="1"><br>Seven generators generate power from the water flow, mainly to supply an aluminium smelting plant in Invercargill.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/257.jpg" border="1"><br>Later back at the camp, we walked around to find the grounds are littered with, well, junk. The Morris Minors were in the majority.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/258.jpg" border="1"><br>An ancient motor home... "Anybody home?"
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/259.jpg" border="1"><br>Well well. A home-made wheel truing stand. Just the thing to fiddle with my clicking front wheel.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/260.jpg" border="1"><br>And a pile of bicycles.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/261.jpg" border="1"><br>Oh look! A Raleigh Twenty! No Moultons though.
</p><h2>Day 12: Manapouri to Tuatapere (80km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/262.jpg" border="1"><br>We were ready to go by dawn. Today a long leg, and the winds were still howling. I thought we would probably have side winds or from right front, making progress painful.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/263.jpg" border="1"><br>The first few km were away from the lake so we had a nice strong tailwind.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/264.jpg" border="1"><br>As we reached the turnoff to Tuatapere, the winds were north-westerly, so I thought well looks OK actually.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/265.jpg" border="1"><br>As usual, killer scenery followed us everywhere.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/266.jpg" border="1"><br>Couple of signs explained the world's fir<b>st</b> hydro power station which had no impact on lake levels.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/267.jpg" border="1"><br>Just the river flow was reduced as the water was diverted through the power station instead.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/268.jpg" border="1"><br>Not much flow was left... still I agree, a good result overall.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/269.jpg" border="1"><br>Just checking everything is still where it should be...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/270.jpg" border="1"><br>A modest climb looms ahead. I was very pleased with the wind; somehow the mountains funneled the winds into a nice strong tailwind - great!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/271.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie labours up the hill... you can see the stalks bending strongly in the wind.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/272.jpg" border="1"><br>Almost there luv!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/273.jpg" border="1"><br>On the flat on the other side of the hill, the wind was stronger still. We were cruising at 38km/h with very little effort!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/274.jpg" border="1"><br>Here you see it - flat road but 36km/h on the speedo.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/275.jpg" border="1"><br>No coffee shops on today's stretch, so this swimming pool at a school served as a shelter from the wind for a snack.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/276.jpg" border="1"><br>As we pulled away, this looooong convoy of mostly antique tractors rolled up.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/277.jpg" border="1"><br>They were going slower than us due to the tailwind so we jumped on and sped away from them.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/278.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie admires a cordeline.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/279.jpg" border="1"><br>Snacking yet again... At about 60km into the ride, the wind finally turned to front right and slowed us down to 15km/h. 
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/280.jpg" border="1"><br>The tractor convoy soon caught up and we pulled off to let them pass. There must have been at least 50 tractors as it took 10 minutes or so for all to trundle past. They were on a fund raising trek for kids with cancer.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/281.jpg" border="1"><br>Nice old suspension bridge at Clifden...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/282.jpg" border="1"><br>The Moulton comparing notes with the bridge about space frames and such...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/283.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie pointed out that we needn't ride back to the road, we could simply carry on and meet the road ahead again.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/284.jpg" border="1"><br>Tuatapere at last. There is a fantastic forest walk next to the river, a real gem straight out of The Lord of the Rings. Plus this interesting-looking cloud. We forgot the camera during the forest walk.

</p><h2>Day 13: Tuatapere to Riverton (50km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/286.jpg" border="1"><br>The forecast for the day was lots of rain with gale force winds. The sky ahead certainly looked nasty. Connie decided she wasn't getting wet so donned all her rain gear in advance.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/287.jpg" border="1"><br>Of course in rain gear you quickly overheat, so off it all came again.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/288.jpg" border="1"><br>To the north the sky was still looking OK.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/289.jpg" border="1"><br>Not the sea - whipped into a frenzy by the winds.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/290.jpg" border="1"><br>About 12km into the ride the storm caught us. These trees were shaped by constant gales - and showed the way they usually blow - along with our direction, heh heh.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/291.jpg" border="1"><br>Another grotesquely wind-distorted tree. These were a common sight along the south coast.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/292.jpg" border="1"><br>With torrential rain beating against our backs, these cows were amazed at the keen cyclists riding in a storm.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/293.jpg" border="1"><br>Riverton! With the gale-force tail-wind, I was in the unusual situation of drafting in <i>front</i> of Connie!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/294.jpg" border="1"><br>After changing into dry clothing, we made a quick visit to the local museum. Check out this penny-farthing's spokes - wires twisted together for tension.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/295.jpg" border="1"><br>We had the nicest room on the tour for a measly $50, ensuite bathroom included.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/296.jpg" border="1"><br>The backpackers was located in an old but well maintained hotel.
</p><h2>Day 14&amp;15: Riverton to Invercargill (84km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/297.jpg" border="1"><br>After a warm night in front of a roaring fire, we were ready for the leg to Invercargill. Just resetting the speedo for the day...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/298.jpg" border="1"><br>The world's bigg<b>est</b> paua shell. Made from tiny mosaic pieces of genuine paua shell.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/299.jpg" border="1"><br>The Riverton estuary at low tide.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/300.jpg" border="1"><br>The sunny weather soon returned. Plus the strong tail wind was still there, pushing us along at top speed.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/301.jpg" border="1"><br>We dropped the luggage at the Invercargill camp with a girl named Ember ('Ember??' 'No not Ember, Eeeember!' 'Oh, <i>Amber</i>!') and headed to town via Queens Park - an amazing piece of work of which we forgot to take pics.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/302.jpg" border="1"><br>First stop - coffee of course!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/303.jpg" border="1"><br>After coffee we toured around the estuary. Connie didn't think Bluff was worth the trip.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/304.jpg" border="1"><br>Hooning around on pedestrian-only walkways...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/305.jpg" border="1"><br>My bum was getting quite sore from the Brooks saddle not breaking in.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/306.jpg" border="1"><br>Back in Queens Park admiring some Dutch girls suntanning just outside the picture.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/307.jpg" border="1"><br>As usual we had fantastic weather. Connie always stops to smell the roses.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/308.jpg" border="1"><br>These gulls and ducks were having a nice pond-side picnic.
</p><h2>Day 16: Invercargill to Waikawa (106km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/309.jpg" border="1"><br>A cold morning after a wet night and Connie decided she wasn't going to freeze or get wet, donning all her stuff again including a rain cap.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/310.jpg" border="1"><br>Three paces of riding and she had to remove most of the stuff.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/311.jpg" border="1"><br>Riding south and the sun finally decides to rise.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/312.jpg" border="1"><br>"Oh snap a piccie of me against the sunrise, Dear!"
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/313.jpg" border="1"><br>More layers go...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/314.jpg" border="1"><br>With the sun came the wind. Check it out, strong tailwind again! Woo-hoo!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/315.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie thanked me many times for the careful planning such that we were going with the prevailing winds where it mattered most.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/316.jpg" border="1"><br>We saw a couple of cycle tourers going west against the wind. They weren't looking happy I tell you.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/317.jpg" border="1"><br>We have already reached Fortrose, "Gateway to the Catlins" before doing much work at all.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/318.jpg" border="1"><br>Coffee and a nice view of the gales at Stirling Tides.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/319.jpg" border="1"><br>I was still tinkering with packing the luggage on the Moulton, improving every day. The elastic cargo net was very handy indeed - I could always add "just one more thing" under it.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/320.jpg" border="1"><br>Riding south at right angles to the wind for a short stretch along more distorted trees.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/321.jpg" border="1"><br>"Bring on those gales!"
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/322.jpg" border="1"><br>The road surface changed to gravel and we spotted our destination, Curio Bay.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/323.jpg" border="1"><br>There is an amazing entire petrified forest here.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/324.jpg" border="1"><br>Unfortunately it is slowly being pilfered.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/325.jpg" border="1"><br>Even the most amazing petrified forest benefits greatly from a sunny flower...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/326.jpg" border="1"><br>Well mostly sunny. "Not another blooming pose..."
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/327.jpg" border="1"><br>This was our most southerly location ever. Next stop just over the horizon, Antarctica.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/328.jpg" border="1"><br>We overnighted at this backpackers in Waikawa, owned and run by a Japanese girl.
</p><h2>Day 17: Waikawa to Papatowai (50km)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/329.jpg" border="1"><br>Some hills are on the menu today. None too bad...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/330.jpg" border="1"><br>...except for the hill on the way to Cathedral Cave parking lot which wiped the smile off Connie's face.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/331.jpg" border="1"><br>I had timed our arrival carefully to coincide with low tide, after the usual morning coffee at the Whistling Frog.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/332.jpg" border="1"><br>Even at low tide you have to get your feet wet.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/333.jpg" border="1"><br>With a nimble little jump onto the rocks after my shouted warning, Connie avoids getting her sock soaked by a particularly intrusive wave.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/334.jpg" border="1"><br>The two caves are linked at the back so here we exit the 2nd cave.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/335.jpg" border="1"><br>No choice but to remove shoes and socks.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/336.jpg" border="1"><br>Doing her best, and succeeding, to improve the looks of a wetland estuary nearby.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/337.jpg" border="1"><br>Then there was lovely Lake Wilkie.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/338.jpg" border="1"><br>Pretty amazing...

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/340.jpg" border="1"><br>Tree jumble.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/341.jpg" border="1"><br>After a very steep little hill Connie arrives at a lookout.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/342.jpg" border="1"><br>This is how I tried to pack the Moulton for the remainder of the trip. Sleeping bag pushed between seatpost and rear rack, all food and wet weather gear in the accessible front pannier, all other clothing in the rear pannier, plastic Crocs under the cargo net at the side. Any other odds and ends went under the net as well.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/343.jpg" border="1"><br>There wasn't much wind today. Just a week ago, while we were in Te Anau where scarcely a leaf stirred, there were extreme once-in-a-century wind-storms here.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/344.jpg" border="1"><br>This guy in Papatowai has the most amazing collection of, well, tricks I have ever seen. Things that you turn handles of, press buttons etc etc etc etc. This sheep skeleton pedals the bike and makes a weird bleating sound. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stRrW71LRdo" target="_blank">youtube video</a>
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/345.jpg" border="1"><br>Inside his bus...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/346.jpg" border="1"><br>There is a theatre as well which we didn't see. 
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/347.jpg" border="1"><br>Sandflies were swarming outside something terrible.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/348.jpg" border="1"><br>Hilltop Backpackers. Steep gravel climb - walking only. I often manage to pick our accommodation at the top of steep slopes.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/349.jpg" border="1"><br>Killer views the place has. Unfortunately we were in a dorm and were kept awake much of that night due to a snoring lady.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/350.jpg" border="1"><br>Just it was drizzling a bit and we didn't spend much time looking at the rain.
</p><h2>Day 18: Papatowai to Kaka Point &amp; Nugget Point (64km) (Hard!)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/351.jpg" border="1"><br>Next morning I catch Connie as she eagerly dashes uphill, ready for the day's challenges after a sleepless night. And challenging they were...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/352.jpg" border="1"><br>Crossing the estuary.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/353.jpg" border="1"><br>All the bridges in this region looked the same.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/354.jpg" border="1"><br>We elected to take a gravel road to the Purakaunui falls. I thought it would be picturesque. Unfortunately, it was freshly graded the very previous day!! Big loose gravel, very cycling unfriendly.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/355.jpg" border="1"><br>At a lookout point Connie spots our previous night's accommodation accross the valley on that hill.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/356.jpg" border="1"><br>I am not buying another Crank Brothers product ever again. This pedal is marketed as stainless steel! Dodgy Brothers...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/357.jpg" border="1"><br>In some places the dirt road was damp from the previous day's drizzle and the mud clogged up the mudguards and brakes.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/360.jpg" border="1"><br>While her back is turned, enjoying the bucolic scene...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/358.jpg" border="1"><br>...I sacrificed Connie's water to clean the muck off the brakes.


</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/361.jpg" border="1"><br>I stopped again due to clogged mudguards but she never noticed. There she is, a small dot on the left...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/362.jpg" border="1"><br>I finally took the mudguards off, they were dragging terribly. So we arrived at the falls, not without strife due to steep gravelled hills.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/363.jpg" border="1"><br>The place is not really blessed with spectacular waterfalls. I regard this a minor cascade. Lot of work we did for this modest prize...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/364.jpg" border="1"><br>With the mudguards back on the bike and the bike back on the bitumen, time for a snack. We were strapped for cash to pay the backpackers but Connie did some very fancy begging tricks to get hold of some.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/365.jpg" border="1"><br>Fast forward... near Nugget Point which Connie said it is crazy to ride the extremely steep gravel road. She's right, it was rather steep and gravelly.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/366.jpg" border="1"><br>Parking the bikes, ready for a short walk to the lighthouse. We have already dropped the panniers at the backpackers in Kaka Point.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/367.jpg" border="1"><br>Putting the layers back on after shedding them all labouring up the track to Nugget Point...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/372.jpg" border="1"><br>That's better.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/368.jpg" border="1"><br>The lighthouse is built on the most amazing rock formation, layers running almost vertically, resulting in these steep straight cliffs falling down to the water level in places.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/369.jpg" border="1"><br>As usual the weather is calm, mostly sunny and warm. This place can really cop storms.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/370.jpg" border="1"><br>There were seals playing most delightfully in a square rock pool down there. Seals were to be found on every rock.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/371.jpg" border="1"><br>"Stand there and smile, dear..."
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/373.jpg" border="1"><br>The view from our backpackers balcony. We had the entire house to ourselves. 
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/374.jpg" border="1"><br>Nugget point was just visible.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/375.jpg" border="1"><br>Sunset as seen from my spot on the couch. With a free washing machine Connie decided to wash everything, clean or not.
</p><h2>Day 19: Kaka Point to Waihola (70km?)</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/376.jpg" border="1"><br>Next morning, a very scenic ride up the coast. That's it for the Catlins!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/377.jpg" border="1"><br>Coffee in Balclutha. Someone asked us about how we were handling the headwinds, but he mistakenly assumed we were travelling south. Not so - we had tailwinds (again!).
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/378.jpg" border="1"><br>Bridge over the Clutha. 
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/379.jpg" border="1"><br>We last saw the Clutha at Alexandra some weeks ago.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/380.jpg" border="1"><br>Other side of Balclutha, there were some interesting moments involving side-winds.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/381.jpg" border="1"><br>First, warnings like these.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/382.jpg" border="1"><br>Riding over these crests, we came next to valleys which funneled very high winds accross the road. We were blown sideways and Connie just managed to prevent crashing off the bike.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/383.jpg" border="1"><br>She was leaning over to the left to counter the furious wind gust, and at the next moment had to quickly correct as she rode out of the wind funnel to avoid riding off the road.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/384.jpg" border="1"><br>Down there was a deceptively quiet-looking valley.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/385.jpg" border="1"><br>However, soon we were out of those dangerous spots and were flying along with a very strong tail-wind. At one spot I was riding over 45km/h on the flat, and coasted for miles when I stopped pedalling. I actually had to brake to turn into this picnic spot. Amazing.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/386.jpg" border="1"><br>The Moulton didn't even break a sweat today with all that tailwind. We had six days of strong tailwinds! And only two with modest headwinds. The rest were quiet.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/387.jpg" border="1"><br>Yet again Connie spots the roses... well, poppies actually.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/389.jpg" border="1"><br>Again a modest cabin at Waihola next to the lake.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/390.jpg" border="1"><br>Many places felt like we were stuck in a time warp. Here it was the early 70s.

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/392.jpg" border="1"><br>These lenticular clouds were often seen over the mountains.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/393.jpg" border="1"><br>Sunset over the lake, and that's it for another sunny day with tailwinds!
</p><h2>Day 20</h2>
<p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/394.jpg" border="1"><br>Today is the last cycling leg of our tour. Just a little hill to reach the Taieri Mouth, then flat all the way to Dunedin. Yeah right...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/396.jpg" border="1"><br>The little hill turned out to be monstrously steep.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/397.jpg" border="1"><br>Not sure what I have to throw at her to wipe that smile...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/399.jpg" border="1"><br>I can see the coast at the left but for some reason the road builders perversely took the highest point that I could see to cross the mountain.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/400.jpg" border="1"><br>That's Dunedin there on the horizon.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/401.jpg" border="1"><br>The early morning sun made taking pictures both easy and difficult.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/402.jpg" border="1"><br>Taieri river, which we last saw while still on the rail trail on the very first day.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/403.jpg" border="1"><br>Right. Morning tea time!
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/404.jpg" border="1"><br>Not much wind, so our speed was a mere 22km/h.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/405.jpg" border="1"><br>Couldn't find a coffee shop anywhere, so we had elevenses here.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/406.jpg" border="1"><br>Coupla prunes for good, erm, tailwinds...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/407.jpg" border="1"><br>My mum tried to teach me not to drink directly from the milk bottle. I think she failed.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/408.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie almost screamed when she saw the last vicious hill to climb into Dunedin, just after this quarry. She walked up. I think it was the world's third steep<b>est</b> road.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/409.jpg" border="1"><br>Over the hill, riding down the world's fourth steep<b>est</b> street.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/410.jpg" border="1"><br>Back at Nextstop Backpackers. I wanted to ride up the world's second steep<b>est</b> street.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/411.jpg" border="1"><br>*puff puff* almost there...
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/412.jpg" border="1"><br>Made it! (Then I had to do it again for the photo opportunity.)
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/413.jpg" border="1"><br>Now to get the bikes back into the suitcases (which the backpackers kept for us).
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/414.jpg" border="1"><br>Dunnydin from our balcony.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/415.jpg" border="1"><br>At the library next day I saw this very rare folding bike with top of the range equipment and very well-worn Brooks saddle. Obviously an expert.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/416.jpg" border="1"><br>Our plans to rent a car and drive to Auckland went awry when there were NO cars available for rent. So bus to Christchurch it is.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/417.jpg" border="1"><br>Goodbye Dunedin!

</p><h2>Day 21</h2>

</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/437.jpg" border="1"><br>...not Connie, smooth as ever.
</p><p><img src="./New Zealand South Island Cycling Tour 4-26 March 2010_files/447.jpg" border="1"><br>She manages to snap the snow-capped peaks a final time. Goodbye South Island! Thanks for a stunning holiday!
