<p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small001.jpg" border="1"><br>Ready to ride, bright and early. Connie On her Reach Offroad, me on the heavily modified Yeah.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small002.jpg" border="1"><br>Struggling up Mt Evelyn. We live near the bottom, and the trail is right at the top of the very steep hill.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small003.jpg" border="1"><br>Pausing a moment in the early morning sunshine at the start next to Cog Cafe.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small004.jpg" border="1"><br>And we're off!
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small005.jpg" border="1"><br>Pausing yet again... this is a rail trail, nice and level. Or not so level, depending on your fitness.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small006.jpg" border="1"><br>See? I'm there too!
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small007.jpg" border="1"><br>We've left the rail trail to go to Healesville. Connie riding briskly up a steep little tester...
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small008.jpg" border="1"><br>and arrives all puffed at Yarra Valley Fruits. She buys apples here once a week - on the bike with panniers. What a gal!
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small009.jpg" border="1"><br>The sun is making its warmth felt after that brisk ride up the hill. "You're going to have to remove the helmet first, dear..."
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small010.jpg" border="1"><br>Zooming past strawberry fields...
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small012.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur spotting a nice rustic reflection through the trees. Motorbikes and cars totally miss delights like these.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small013.jpg" border="1"><br>Stunning place we live in.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small014.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur also divesting himself of vest and gloves... off to the left just outside the field of view, cows look on curiously. Or stoically. Or stupidly whatever.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small015.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie gazes fondly at the Yarra valley and spots a couple of (what jur romantically hopes are) eagles drifing on air currents.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small016.jpg" border="1"><br>Heaps of wineries in this region. Too many in fact - they can hardly get rid of their wine.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small017.jpg" border="1"><br>We've just branched left off Maroondah Hwy on a nice quite alternative road, with a very steep downhill lurking ahead.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small018.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie enhancing the scenery...
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small021.jpg" border="1"><br>This shortcut also bridges the Yarra, with far nicer looks than the main road bridge. You gotta watch it though, this is directly at the bottom of that steep hill. I suppose that's where one can expect rivers to be.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small023.jpg" border="1"><br>We've just consumed some nice consumables at the Beechworth Bakery, which isn't in Beechworth at all, it's in Healesville. Figure it out.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small024.jpg" border="1"><br>On the Koo Wee Rup road, we pass this beauty spot, near where one of the last Victorian Aboriginal Reserves was located. It's a winery now. The Yarra flows in that valley with Warramate Reserve in the background.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small025.jpg" border="1"><br>This place is amazing. There is no end to stunning views. Of course it helps to be here on a sunny spring day.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small026.jpg" border="1"><br>Will the scenery ever end?
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small027.jpg" border="1"><br>Nope it won't.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small029.jpg" border="1"><br>Having rejoined the rail trail on the return leg, Connie tries to ignore Mt Toolebewong, hoping the rail trail remains level.<br>The soaking paddock in the background is deceptive - we are suffering the driest September since record-keeping began 150y ago.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small030.jpg" border="1"><br>We're nearing the end of the ride on this the last long climb on the rail trail. It has to ascend Mt Evelyn.
</p><p><img src="./Mt Evelyn-Healesville Annual Spring Ride 2008_files/small031.jpg" border="1"><br>At the last cutting we arrive at the end. What a day!
