</p><h2>Day 1, leg 1: Bairnsdale to Mississippi Creek Trail: 42km</h2>
<p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour001.jpg" border="1"><br>Bikes packed in the Rav 4, ready to go.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour002.jpg" border="1"><br>We've arrived in Bairnsdale, time to unpack the bikes and unfold them.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour003.jpg" border="1"><br>My Downtube Mini's ready, now for Connie's Reach Offroad...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour004.jpg" border="1"><br>...just getting this doohickey right...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour005.jpg" border="1"><br>...making sure the saddle is aligned...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour006.jpg" border="1"><br>...fiddle with the handlbars, and we're done. Finally!
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour007.jpg" border="1"><br>Start of the trail!
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour008.jpg" border="1"><br>We've barely begun and she's already thirsty.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour009.jpg" border="1"><br>Aha! First glimpse of the lakes!
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour010.jpg" border="1"><br>Pausing for some photos on the Nicholson River bridge, and Jur getting grumpy because she's making a production of it.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour011.jpg" border="1"><br>Now she's grumpy, too.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour012.jpg" border="1"><br>Grumpiness left behind, we arrive at a wayside farm. A bushfire looms in the distance exactly where we're going.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour013.jpg" border="1"><br>Resting to eat a snack. I was carrying all the food, tools, spares and sundry heavy stuff plus my street clothes, while Connie carried a spare set of clothes.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour014.jpg" border="1"><br>My Mini looking eager to tackle anything. You can't buy these in Australia, my boss kindly brought it from the US for me. <br>Widely regarded as the best value-for-money 16" folder on the market, it rides very well, has gentle rear suspension and an 8-speed Sturmey-Archer geared hub.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour015.jpg" border="1"><br>Did I mention this is a rail trail? Well, they have tunnels with cyclists emerging from them. Some sections in this vicinity were literally impossible to ride through - <br>deep loose sand with a thin treacherous crust giving the appearance of terra firma.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour016.jpg" border="1"><br>Ever closer to that bush fire.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour017.jpg" border="1"><br>The trail dips through a um, dip, with the original trestle bridge derelict. Pity.
</p><h2>Day 1, leg 2: Mississippi Creek Trail to Lakes Entrance: 26km</h2>
<p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour018.jpg" border="1"><br>We have arrived at the Mississippi Creek Trail. The smoke was thick, causing this gloom, with ash falling from the sky. But there was not a breath of wind, so I thought we were quite safe.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour019.jpg" border="1"><br>Not a rail trail, it goes up and down with the terrain. It starts out flat enough.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour020.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie has arrived at Quarry picnic ground, site of an old disused granite quarry.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour021.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur's already there.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour022.jpg" border="1"><br>Man-eating croc... errr, no, wait...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour023.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie zooming away after another quick snack at the quarry.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour024.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur racing to catch up. The trail is now following an old quarry tram track...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour025.jpg" border="1"><br>... passing over the creek a number of times. The creek doesn't deserve its name, it doen't look like Old Man River, and doesn't even flow.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour026.jpg" border="1"><br>Log Crossing picnic ground.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour027.jpg" border="1"><br>The bikes taking a breather...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour028.jpg" border="1"><br>... while Connie inspects the facilities.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour029.jpg" border="1"><br>On our way again, Jur tries to ride through under a fallen tree...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour030.jpg" border="1"><br>... but after bashing his head against the tree and almost plunging into the undergrowth in the process, decides it's safer to walk through.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour031.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie, ever wise, didn't try to ride through.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour032.jpg" border="1"><br>Nice scenery, huh? I must say, the DSE really nailed it with this track. Very nice indeed, rail trails are boring against this.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour033.jpg" border="1"><br>We're off the track on the last stretch of road, taking obligatory pics of horses.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour034.jpg" border="1"><br>First glimpse of the sea.
</p><h2>Day 2: Loafing at Lakes Entrance</h2>
<p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour035.jpg" border="1"><br>Lord's day at Lakes entrance. After cycling to church we pedalled on to Lake Tyers. This is the beach on a long weekend! There was a surfing competition at Lakes, but as you can see, it turned into a bobbing competition.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour036.jpg" border="1"><br>Having a coffee...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour037.jpg" border="1"><br>Just a boring old sign.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour038.jpg" border="1"><br>Crossing a number of small rivers.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour039.jpg" border="1"><br>Again...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour040.jpg" border="1"><br>Snacking time again, with a magpie hiding.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour041.jpg" border="1"><br>What are you looking at?
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour042.jpg" border="1"><br>The magpie, dear...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour043.jpg" border="1"><br>At the fisherman's wharf these long-haired girls were unloading the catch of the day.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour044.jpg" border="1"><br>Lakes Entrance.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour054.jpg" border="1"><br>Spectacular place.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour055.jpg" border="1"><br>Fish &amp; chips at the harbour with gulls looking on longingly.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour056.jpg" border="1"><br>And that's the end of the day.
</p><h2>Day 3: Back to Bairnsdale</h2>
<p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour057.jpg" border="1"><br>Before first light we had the bikes loaded up.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour058.jpg" border="1"><br>Despite a very hot forecast for the day, it was quite chilly before dawn.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour059.jpg" border="1"><br>Just outside Lakes we spot first light.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour060.jpg" border="1"><br>Back at the start of the trail, still before sunrise. It has warmed up and we packed away the warmers.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour061.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur hooning down the trail in the dawn light...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour062.jpg" border="1"><br>...followed by Connie calling, "slowing!"
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour063.jpg" border="1"><br>Tackling some steeper bits...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour064.jpg" border="1"><br>Doesn't look steep...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour065.jpg" border="1"><br>Aim between the poles, Jur!
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour066.jpg" border="1"><br>The sun rises as last like a glowing fire through the bush.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour067.jpg" border="1"><br>Tackling some more difficult bits, this time stony track...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour068.jpg" border="1"><br>...followed by deep loose gravel...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour069.jpg" border="1"><br>...and having fallen over, inspects the bike for damage.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour070.jpg" border="1"><br>No damage, so try again.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour071.jpg" border="1"><br>Brute force gets me through.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour072.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie is already waiting after picking up her bike over another fallen tree.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour073.jpg" border="1"><br>This cutting is a clear sign of the old quarry tram track. It was massive fun to ride.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour074.jpg" border="1"><br>Some bits were damaged by recent rain.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour075.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur negotiating some damaged bits...
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour076.jpg" border="1"><br>... and looking rather relieved he made it without falling over this time.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour077.jpg" border="1"><br>"Right, dear, snap me as I effortlessly sail up this steep bit"
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour078.jpg" border="1"><br>"D'oh! gears not low enough."
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour079.jpg" border="1"><br>This was the view for much of the day.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour080.jpg" border="1"><br>Back on the rail trail with the weather hotting up.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour081.jpg" border="1"><br>"Nice view! What the... dear, your rear tyre's flat!" It was a BIG iron curl that punctured the tube on both sides.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour082.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur pressed into service to fix other people's problems. There were compensations.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour083.jpg" border="1"><br>Having morning tea at Bruthen, another magpie looks on hungrily.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour084.jpg" border="1"><br>See? Birds do have binocular vision. Shoo!
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour086.jpg" border="1"><br>Hot hot hot. At the same wayside farm, we take a breather under the tree again. The temperature soared to 38*C.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour087.jpg" border="1"><br>Back at the Nicholson river bridge, these guys were having a pleasant loaf on the boat.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour088.jpg" border="1"><br>This time we managed to shoot some pics on the bridge without getting grumpy.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour089.jpg" border="1"><br>Back at the car. Journey is over. The temperature got to 40-ish.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour090.jpg" border="1"><br>Connie thankfully taking off the helmet for the last time of the day.
</p><p><img src="./Lakes Entrance Cycling Tour Holiday 8-10 March 2008_files/Lakestour091.jpg" border="1"><br>Jur checking that the bikes are secure before tackling the 4-hour drive back home.
