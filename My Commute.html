<p><img src="./My Commute_files/commutemap.gif" border="1"><br>My commute on the map.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/commutesatellite.jpg" border="1"><br>My commute on satellite.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/sunrise.jpg" border="1"><br>Looks like a nice day today, 15/3/06.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4012.jpg" border="1"><br>Which shoes today? I think the sandals. Thanks for sending them, Eggplant Jeff!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4014.jpg" border="1"><br>My stuff for the day. Sweat band, arm warmers, helmet, sunnies, banana in double layer bubble bag, muesli &amp; yoghurt, 2 slices of bread, egg, apple, phone, bike gloves and full finger knitted gloves. And a Topeak bag which also contains tube, tools rain gear etc.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4015.jpg" border="1"><br>Hello boys! Did you miss me?
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/dscn4216.jpg" border="1"><br>Quiet, you!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4017.jpg" border="1"><br>My commuter: Singlespeed 46x16x700c, polished frame, Salsa carbon fork, carbon bars, titanium stem, butchered Brooks B17, Topeak seatpost rack, Vittoria Randonneurs 700cx28, buggered SKS chromoplastic fenders, Crank Bros candy pedals, Biopace chain ring.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4019.jpg" border="1"><br>That's where I have to go now - the road in front of my house.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4020.jpg" border="1"><br>ready steady go!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4021.jpg" border="1"><br>Both brakes needed for the steep gravel bit... Of course I have only one brake right now so press the left foot into service.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4022.jpg" border="1"><br>Clear to the left...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4023.jpg" border="1"><br>Clear to the right...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4024.jpg" border="1"><br>Go!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/dscn4217.jpg" border="1"><br>Bye Luv!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4025.jpg" border="1"><br>Bit of singletrack to the left. Boggy patch near the bottom. Not for SS.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4026.jpg" border="1"><br>York Rd. Have to turn left. Always very busy, and very narrow.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4027.jpg" border="1"><br>Left turn, on gravel shoulder.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4028.jpg" border="1"><br>Meet up with service road.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4029.jpg" border="1"><br>Check that Mr Airfix isn't coming out - he never looks.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4030.jpg" border="1"><br>Children's school. Only my daughter now goes there, others are all grown up!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4031.jpg" border="1"><br>Everything still there? Check.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4032.jpg" border="1"><br>Cross side roads with care. Drivers never expect anybody. And I'm supposed to give way anyway.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4033.jpg" border="1"><br>Continue on service road. Magpie attacks here during October.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4034.jpg" border="1"><br>Legs feel a bit chilly...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4035.jpg" border="1"><br>Left and up this steep bit...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4036.jpg" border="1"><br>OK. Must remember to put Loctite on this titanium stem.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4037.jpg" border="1"><br>...and down this path on the right.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4038.jpg" border="1"><br>Check for sticks...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4039.jpg" border="1"><br>... and join the road.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4040.jpg" border="1"><br>Swansea Rd ahead, suicidally busy.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4043.jpg" border="1"><br>But that's irrelevant, I'll be taking this gravel path.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4044.jpg" border="1"><br>Tyres crunching on gravel.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4045.jpg" border="1"><br>The path stretching out ahead of me.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4046.jpg" border="1"><br>Rat race on the right,
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4047.jpg" border="1"><br>peace on the left,
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4048.jpg" border="1"><br>and boggy clay patch ahead.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4050.jpg" border="1"><br>"Good morning!"
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4051.jpg" border="1"><br>Big water-filled holes. I broke 2 SKS mudguards near here
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4052.jpg" border="1"><br>Join the service road.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4053.jpg" border="1"><br>Crossing side roads with care...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4054.jpg" border="1"><br>I have to join Swansea rd just ahead.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4055.jpg" border="1"><br>Quick check in the third eye helmet mirror... Go!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4056.jpg" border="1"><br>Rejoin the side walk. There's never anyone there anyway.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4057.jpg" border="1"><br>You have to admit it's better than the road.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4058.jpg" border="1"><br>End of sidewalk. What are pedestrians supposed to do here? Quiet side road again.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4059.jpg" border="1"><br>I've lost some weight, that wind vest was a lot tighter a year ago!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4060.jpg" border="1"><br>Dandenong Tourist Rd ahead. I'll be going right.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4061.jpg" border="1"><br>My 2-weekly time trial route is up the mountain to the left...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4062.jpg" border="1"><br>... but work is to the right.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4063.jpg" border="1"><br>Most people are still in bed.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4064.jpg" border="1"><br>puff puff puff
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4065.jpg" border="1"><br>There's the rat race. I'll be going left at this roundabout.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4066.jpg" border="1"><br>A whole lane just for me - wheeeeee!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4067.jpg" border="1"><br>Highest point in the commute - Montrose hill, 195m.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4068.jpg" border="1"><br>Melbourne eastern suburbs lie below in the distance ahead.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4069.jpg" border="1"><br>I can get over 70km/h down here if traffic doesn't block me. Today this truck is going slow.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4070.jpg" border="1"><br>Zooming along at about 50km/h behind that truck.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4071.jpg" border="1"><br>Traffic piles up at the traffic light. I use the left lane meant for buses (but taken by rude drivers; hence, 'rude lane') to go past the truck.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4072.jpg" border="1"><br>Rude lane ends. No shoulder ahead. Take yer chances and use 3rd eye mirror. I am now ahead of that slow truck.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4074.jpg" border="1"><br>About 45km/h here on the level stretch. Pedalling as fast as I can, bouncing on the saddle.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4075.jpg" border="1"><br>Ahhh, wide shoulder again. Time to turn left into Colchester. Site of vicious magpie attacks.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4076.jpg" border="1"><br>Since the light is red I'll be taking a short cut on the left...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4077.jpg" border="1"><br>... through this industrial estate....
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4078.jpg" border="1"><br>... and rejoin the road here.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4079.jpg" border="1"><br>Just turned on to the road after this car passed.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4080.jpg" border="1"><br>Nice bit of smooth fresh tar.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4081.jpg" border="1"><br>Musn't crash into this truck or ride up its ramps.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4082.jpg" border="1"><br>This brand new wide shoulder has just been freshly tarred since yesterday, so today it is my own personal bike lane.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4083.jpg" border="1"><br>Hang a right here.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4084.jpg" border="1"><br>And back into quiet suburbia. I see my shadow. I must be late today.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4085.jpg" border="1"><br>Ah! The sun has just peeked over the Dandenongs behind me.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4086.jpg" border="1"><br>Time for some speed.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4087.jpg" border="1"><br>Luggage still there.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4088.jpg" border="1"><br>Another right turn. About one third through the commute, 9km.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4089.jpg" border="1"><br>BMX playground.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4090.jpg" border="1"><br>Whooshing along.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4091.jpg" border="1"><br>Bike path in sight just ahead.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4092.jpg" border="1"><br>Ahhhhh, peace and quiet.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4093.jpg" border="1"><br>They had some extra tar mix left over, so made some slaloms to use it up. The track on the left shows not everyone likes the slalom.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4095.jpg" border="1"><br>"Oh, hello!" One of the regulars I see many mornings.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4097.jpg" border="1"><br>Tunnel under Dorset Rd. Floods during heavy rain.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4098.jpg" border="1"><br>Coming through!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4099.jpg" border="1"><br>But where's the creek?? Underground in a pipe on the left. With heavy rain the pipe fills up and the rest runs over ground.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/benq0007.jpg" border="1"><br>Like this, taken a few weeks later.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4101.jpg" border="1"><br>"Ding ding!"
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4100.jpg" border="1"><br>"Morning!" Another regular.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4102.jpg" border="1"><br>Cross through creek to the other side.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4103.jpg" border="1"><br>Past Siemens.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4104.jpg" border="1"><br>pedal pedal pedal...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4105.jpg" border="1"><br>...and through the creek again...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4106.jpg" border="1"><br>...past another tight slalom with blind spot - on the way home watch for other cyclists who tend to cut this corner like I'm doing right now. Keep left cretin!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4107.jpg" border="1"><br>Approaching another tunnel under a main street.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4108.jpg" border="1"><br>Watch again for cyclists.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4109.jpg" border="1"><br>Good thing the creek isn't flooded today.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4110.jpg" border="1"><br>Footy field on the left,
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4112.jpg" border="1"><br>... defaced memorial sign on the right.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4113.jpg" border="1"><br>Uh, gudday.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4114.jpg" border="1"><br>If I'm on the MTB I bomb through the creek on the right, today I take the bridge on the left.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4115.jpg" border="1"><br>Looking back, the creek comes above ground at last.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4118.jpg" border="1"><br>Another Sir Hubert Opperman memorial...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4119.jpg" border="1"><br>... and its signpost. See? Lance was not the first cyclist to "dance on the pedals."
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4121.jpg" border="1"><br>"Morning!" Another regular.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4122.jpg" border="1"><br>Through under the railway.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4123.jpg" border="1"><br>"Ding ding ding!" Warn opposite traffic through that tight right turn ahead. Had many a tight scrape here.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4124.jpg" border="1"><br>Past the giant ropes course on the left.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4126.jpg" border="1"><br>That says "FLOODWAY". Yep, I had floods here a number of times.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/benq0010.jpg" border="1"><br>Right here. Gotten the bottom bracket soaked, not to mention my feet. This taken a few weeks later during a mild flooding.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4128.jpg" border="1"><br>More traffic.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4129.jpg" border="1"><br>No time for playing this morning.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4132.jpg" border="1"><br>Must make speed, *puff puff*
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4134.jpg" border="1"><br>"Ding ding!" *quack quack*
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/benq0005.jpg" border="1"><br>One day coming home, the creek was polluted which gave it this vivid red color.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/benq0006.jpg" border="1"><br> Exodus 7:20 Moses ... raised his staff ... and struck the water of the Nile, and all the water was changed into blood.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4137.jpg" border="1"><br>I'd rather ride in rain than drive through traffic. A very simple inequality that keeps me on the bike in all weather.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4138.jpg" border="1"><br>Ahhhhhh....
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4139.jpg" border="1"><br>Down bike. Wade through dewed grass.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4141.jpg" border="1"><br>Look! Horsies on the other side!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4143.jpg" border="1"><br>Bugger! My socks are wet now. And the sandals are a teensie weensie bit large for me, but they work just fine.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4144.jpg" border="1"><br>No wading through wet grass for these birds - they are keeping their feet dry.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4145.jpg" border="1"><br>Riding on...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4146.jpg" border="1"><br>and on...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4147.jpg" border="1"><br>pedalling the single speed... do you see the crack in the rear mudguard? From a stick flipped up and caught in the spokes, catching against the mudguard stays.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4140.jpg" border="1"><br>Boy I am lucky.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/dscn4220.jpg" border="1"><br>
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4148.jpg" border="1"><br>Does the fun ever stop?
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4149.jpg" border="1"><br>My eyes! what's wrong with my eyes! Must drink water!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4150.jpg" border="1"><br>Ah, eyesight is clearing... "Hello!"
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4152.jpg" border="1"><br>Another floodway.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4153.jpg" border="1"><br>Gets a bit narrow here - tight when other cyclists come bowling around the bend.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4156.jpg" border="1"><br>Lots of traffic today... I think this is Kam, a very friendly regular.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4157.jpg" border="1"><br>The lads having a quiet game. Don't you have jobs?
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4160.jpg" border="1"><br>They're building a freeway, correction, TOLLway over here.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4158.jpg" border="1"><br>It will cross the creek and path with a bridge. Finish 2008. A bike path next to it will join up with this one and make most of my commute on bike paths.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4161.jpg" border="1"><br>"Gudday, maaaaate!" This dude has da beat organised, check under his chair.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4164.jpg" border="1"><br>Gotta cross this bridge and leave the creek trail.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4165.jpg" border="1"><br>Right here.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4166.jpg" border="1"><br>Going over...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4168.jpg" border="1"><br>The creek comes from the Dandenongs...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4167.jpg" border="1"><br>... and continues on its watery way to the bay. With 50 magnificent km of bike path all the way.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4169.jpg" border="1"><br>Slippery boardwalk when wet. I crashed here some months ago and injured my shoulder.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4170.jpg" border="1"><br>The steepest climb in my ride. This 15% slope detemines my gear ratio of 46x16, I can only just make it uphill if I don't stop. You can form an idea of the slope by the horizontal bits of the white and brown fence on the right.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4171.jpg" border="1"><br>A final look over the creek valley.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4173.jpg" border="1"><br>Of course I stopped for the previous pic so now I have to walk the rest of the hill.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4174.jpg" border="1"><br>Cresting the hill.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4175.jpg" border="1"><br>Don't crash into this truck parked in the bike lane.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4176.jpg" border="1"><br>Canterbury Rd up ahead again which I left about 10km ago.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4177.jpg" border="1"><br>Looks quiet this morning. School holidays.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4178.jpg" border="1"><br>My home is about 15km thataway. I'm about 2/3rds through the commute, about 18km.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4179.jpg" border="1"><br>Green light at last.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4180.jpg" border="1"><br>I can go via back streets...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4182.jpg" border="1"><br>where I never see any traffic...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/dscn4221.jpg" border="1"><br>or I can go through another park with a trail...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/dscn4222.jpg" border="1"><br>and some singletrack. Same distance.

</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4184.jpg" border="1"><br>A local BMX playground at the singletrack exit.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4185.jpg" border="1"><br>Yet another roundabout.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4186.jpg" border="1"><br>Despite taking the lane this one edges right by me.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4187.jpg" border="1"><br>Left up ahead onto bike paths again!
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4188.jpg" border="1"><br>First this gravelly bit...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4189.jpg" border="1"><br>then a tarred section past the water retarding basin...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4190.jpg" border="1"><br>which is only retarding some dew this morning.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4191.jpg" border="1"><br>Cross this road
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4192.jpg" border="1"><br>then onto the Somers trail.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4193.jpg" border="1"><br>Priti priti trail...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/dscn4223.jpg" border="1"><br>with a babbling brook ...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4194.jpg" border="1"><br>and rustic rails ...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4195.jpg" border="1"><br>to keep old ladies and their dogs from falling in.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4196.jpg" border="1"><br>On through a park
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4197.jpg" border="1"><br>and back on the road. Right turn ahead.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4198.jpg" border="1"><br>Like so...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4199.jpg" border="1"><br>Speed bumps. Meant for cars only.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4200.jpg" border="1"><br>No bike computer. Just good clean fun.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4201.jpg" border="1"><br>Another roundabout before crossing under the same railway from waaaaaay back.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4202.jpg" border="1"><br>Crossing this main road, Maroondah Highway.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4204.jpg" border="1"><br>I'll be going there...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4205.jpg" border="1"><br>on quiet, shady suburban lanes...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4206.jpg" border="1"><br>with many traffic cooling down measures...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4207.jpg" border="1"><br>and endless roundabouts. Roundabout # 4,167,442. Turn right here.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4208.jpg" border="1"><br>More cars here...
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4210.jpg" border="1"><br>Roundabout # 4,167,443.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4211.jpg" border="1"><br>Roundabout # 4,167,444.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4212.jpg" border="1"><br>The lady in this white car drove patiently behind me through all those roundabouts while I took the lane.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4213.jpg" border="1"><br>Mitcham Rd. Rat race. Turn right.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4214.jpg" border="1"><br>"Hi Gladys! Nice day today!" That's the lady who conducts school children accross. Only she's not there coz it's holidays, see?
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/DSCN4215.jpg" border="1"><br>I'm taking the lane here, whether you like it or not.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/dscn4224.jpg" border="1"><br>Crossing freeway, correction TOLLway, at the start where contractors park their stuff. Once finished, my bike route will be bike paths 2/3rds of the way.
</p><p><img src="./My Commute_files/dscn4225.jpg" border="1"><br>So instead of entering the Koonung trail here, I'll be coming from the left already on the trail for miles.
